Rowan is a boy in the fictional series of the Arc of a Scythe series, Which in my opinion has developed their character the most.
# About his universe
In the Arc of a Scythe series, the world is set in a far future where death is completely extinguished. People can live forever, and can set back their physical age (Called "Turning the corner"), to whatever they want as long as it's over 18 years (because of technical limitations).
The world also has an all knowing and loving AI called "The Thunderhead" which stewards and leads humanity. The thunderhead emerged from the internet and encompasses all information. If you are scared of it killing everyone and everything, don't worry, because it wont.
But to curb the population, there have to be "Scythes" who kill or "glean" people. The organization of scythes, called the scythedom, is completely separate from the thunderhead. The scythes only have 10 commandments and are above all laws.
# About the Character
Rowan is in a large family, and describes himself as the "lettuce of the family," which means he is insignificant to his family because "his brothers and sisters are the meat and tomatoes" up until he is chosen for a scythe apprenticeship.
His only friend is called Tyger who is also the lettuce in his own family, and is a "splat" junkie. Splatting means killing themselves for fun by for example jumping from a tower, and therefore the name "splatting".
Once he is chosen for a scythe apprenticeship, he has all the family members asking him for immunity for one year from gleaning which is given by kissing the scythe's ring.
He doesn't have any hobbies, and he goes to school. He is blamed for the gleaning of the school quarterback's gleaning, and bullied until he goes into another school. 
There is SO much more I can write about him I didn't have time for.

In conclusion, he is an "outsider" who doesn't do much, but one he gets the scythe apprenticeship, everyone wants to be his friend just for gleaning immunity. And I could have written much more but there is no context for it above. In all, I definitely recommend reading the series. it is one of my favorites to date.
