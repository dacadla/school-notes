# Newspeak discussion
Question: *In the first chapters of '1984' by George Orwell, the concept of 'Newspeak' is introduced as a powerful tool for controlling thought and suppressing dissent. Research and discuss how language manipulation, as depicted in the early chapters, serves as a means of control in the dystopian world of '1984.' How does the novel illustrate the relationship between language, power, and control, and what parallels can be drawn to real-world examples of language manipulation in history or contemporary society?* [Discussion](https://eisb.managebac.com/student/classes/12404488/discussions/24133623#)

Bullet Points
- The ministry names are hypocritical: the ministry of love concerns itself with torture, the ministry of peace concerns itself with war, the ministry of truth concerns itself with lies, and the ministry of plenty concerns itself with starvation. These names normalize the process of their work in the eyes of the people.
- Newspeak makes thoughtcrime impossible by limiting the range of thought with removing thoughtcrime-causing words from Newspeak. As Syme says, he destroys more words than he creates for the eleventh edition for the Newspeak dictionary.
- As said before, limiting the range of thought stops human free will in its tracks, since they don't have the words to express their discontent. 
- With the limited free will, the Party can impose their dominance more efficiently than if done through conventional means.
- Newspeak removes synonyms and antonyms to remove different shades of meaning. for example bad is just UNGOOD, terrible is PLUSUNGOOD, and very good or excellent is PLUSGOOD. This removes the ability to express different levels of meaning outside of the predefined prefixes.
- There are no enemies, friends, or coworkers in the party, you are just supposed to call them "comrades." this limits their discontent or reverence for certain persons, letting that reverence or discontent go to either Big Brother or Goldstein.
