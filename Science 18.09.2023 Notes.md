# Scalar qualities vs Vector qualities
- Scalar quantities
	- Only has magnitude (Number + Unit)
	- For example: 
		- Time
		- Mass
		- Speed
		- Distance
		- Area
		- Volume
		- Energy

- Vector quantities
	- Contains magnitude + direction
		- Coordinates for example
	- Can be represented by an arrow
		- Length of the arrow is the magnitude, and the arrow direction is well.. the direction.
	- For example:
		- Force
		- Velocity
		- Acceleration
		- Displacement
	- Can sum vectors by putting the tail of the second one to the head of the first one
