**Inquiring and Analyzing**

**Project Description:**
The project titled "How Computers Work" aims to create an educational solution to help children aged 12 to 14 understand the fundamental concepts of how computers function. This will include explanations of basic hardware and software components. The solution will be developed using PHP as the programming language.

**Goals:**
- Create a user-friendly and engaging educational resource.
- Explain computer hardware and software concepts in simple terms.
- Use PHP to build an interactive and informative platform.

**Target Audience/Users:**
The primary target audience for this project is students in the MYP 1/2/3 age group (approximately 12 to 14 years old). The solution is designed to be accessible and engaging for this demographic, considering their level of understanding and curiosity about computers.

**Justification:**
The need for this solution arises from the increasing importance of computer literacy in the modern world. It's essential for young students to have a foundational understanding of how computers work, as they are integral to various aspects of their lives, from education to daily tasks.

**Information and Data Collection:**
To create an effective educational solution, we need to collect information on:
- The basics of computer hardware (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.).
- The concept of software (operating systems, applications).
- The chosen programming language (PHP).

This information can be gathered from reputable educational sources, textbooks, and online tutorials.

**Existing Solutions:**
Examples of existing solutions include online educational platforms, interactive websites, and software applications designed to teach computer basics. These solutions will be evaluated to identify strengths and weaknesses and guide the development process.

**Tools (Hardware & Software):**
For this project, we will need:
- Hardware: A computer for development and testing purposes.
- Software: A code editor for PHP development, a web server for hosting the solution, and graphic design tools if necessary.

**Time Frame:**
The project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months to complete, including research, development, testing, and finalization.

**Developing Ideas**

**Design Specification:**
**Success Criteria:**
1. The solution should provide clear and engaging explanations of computer hardware and software.
2. It should be interactive, allowing users to explore concepts through quizzes, animations, and practical examples.
3. The content should be age-appropriate and easily digestible.
4. Navigation should be intuitive, and the user interface should be visually appealing.

**Diagrams and Flowcharts:**
Flowcharts will be created to illustrate the logical flow of the educational content and interactive elements.

**Mock-ups and Prototypes:**
Mock-ups of the user interface will be created to visualize the design before development begins. Prototypes may also be developed for user testing.

**Choice of Styles and Formats:**
The solution will use a colorful and visually engaging design with age-appropriate fonts and graphics. Interactive elements will be used to enhance the learning experience.

**Creating the Solution**

**Using PHP:**
PHP will be used to develop the interactive elements of the solution, such as quizzes and animations. Screenshots will be provided to demonstrate the coding process.

**Changes from Initial Design:**
Any changes made during development will be documented. These changes may include adjustments to the user interface, content organization, or interactive features based on usability testing and feedback.

**Evaluating**

**Achievement of Goals:**
The project's success will be evaluated based on whether it achieved its initial goals, which are to educate young students about computer hardware and software in an engaging way.

**Testing:**
User testing will be conducted to gather feedback on usability and effectiveness. Changes will be made based on this feedback.

**Difficulties:**
Challenges related to PHP development, design, and content creation will be documented. Solutions or workarounds will be noted.

**Impact on Target Audience:**
The impact of the solution on the target audience will be assessed through user feedback and engagement metrics. Positive impact will be measured by increased understanding of computer concepts.

**Future Development:**
To further develop the solution, additional content and features could be added, and it could be made accessible on multiple platforms, including mobile devices. Regular updates to keep the content relevant will also be considered.
