I walked down the stark, sterile halls of the hospital, my steps echoing in the silence. Hospitals weren't my favorite places, and I didn't visit them unless I had to. But this time, I had to.

Ponyboy and Johnny had been through hell. That church fire had messed them up bad. I couldn't shake the guilt that gnawed at me, knowing that we had gotten them into this mess. We were a family, though, and I had to be there for my boys.

As I approached the room, I took a deep breath, trying to steel myself for what I was about to see. The door swung open, and there they were, lying in those sterile hospital beds, like a couple of wounded soldiers.

Ponyboy looked pale, his eyes tired, but when he saw me, a small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Johnny, on the other hand, was still as a statue, his face covered in bandages. It was hard to see him like that, so broken and fragile.

I pulled up a chair and sat down beside them, the cold, hard plastic digging into my skin. I didn't say much, words were never my strong suit. But I was there, and they knew it. I lit a cigarette, even though I wasn't supposed to smoke in there, but rules had never meant much to me.

I watched as Ponyboy and Johnny exchanged glances, their unspoken bond stronger than any words could convey. They were like brothers to me, and seeing them like this, vulnerable and hurt, it tore me up inside.

I reached out and ruffled Ponyboy's hair, a rare display of affection from me. He needed to know that we were in this together, no matter what. Johnny's hand twitched, and I squeezed it gently. He might not make it out of this mess, but he needed to know that we cared.

The room was heavy with silence, but it was a silence that spoke volumes. We were greasers, outsiders, but in that moment, we were a family, and nothing could break that bond. I'd do whatever it took to protect my boys, even if it meant facing the harsh reality of a hospital room.
