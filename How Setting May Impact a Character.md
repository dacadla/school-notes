# Impact on my character from the Setting
Rowan is influenced by many of these factors, for example the time period. The story is set in the far future, where death is eradicated and there is a very friendly AI that is the "caretaker" of humanity. In this future, Rowan can't seem to grasp the concept of death until he becomes a scythe's apprentice. Because Rowan now works with death every day, he finally understands that death is just... well death. Because death doesn't exist anymore, there are no more hardships or serious rivalries, because you were not limited by the time of your passing to settle those hardships. For the same reason, the world "slowed down" and many people work "toy" jobs while the thunderhead does almost all of the work. The thunderhead also understands that people need something to do to not go insane, s
o it gives them toy jobs.
