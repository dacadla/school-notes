- Motion is VERY important
- "Time and tide waits for none"
	- We should move with time
- When things move, we usually see them as moving
- When things don't move, we usually see them as not moving
	- But are we actually not moving?
- Motion is relative
	- It's all about perspective
	- You don't think you are moving when you are sitting on a bench on earth, but astronauts see the motion of the earth too.

- Rectilinear motion
	- Moves in a straight line -- like a race
- Curvilinear motion
	- Moves in a curve
	- Like when throwing a ball
- Parabolic motion
	- Special case of curvilinear motion that moves in a parabola
- Circular motion
	- Moves in a motion
- Oscillatory motion
	- Moves in a pendulum
- Vibratory motion
	- Moves at a very fast rate
	- For example musical instruments such as drums and guitars
- Periodic motion
	- repeats after regular time
- Transitory motion

- Uniform -- motion
	- Repeats at a _uniform_ rate
- Nonuniform -- motion
	- _Doesn't_ repeat at a uniform rate
- Both can be applied to different types of motion

- Kinetic means motion
- Kinematics is the study of motion

# How does this tie in with vector and scalar quantities?
- distance just has magnitude
- displacement has magnitude and direction

- Time to walk is 5.02 seconds + 6.81 seconds
- t1=5s -> 2m
	- speed: 2m/5s = .4 m/s
	- velocity: .4 m/s _to the east_
- t2=7s -> 2m
	- speed: 2m/7s = 0.28 m/s
	- velocity: .28 m/s _to the west_
- together
	- speed: 4m / 12s = 0.33 m/s
		- average velocity
	- velocity: 0m / 12s = 0 m/s
- speed = distance/time
- velocity = deltadistance/time + direction
- speed = scalar
- velocity = vector

- How do we write this? Use a GRAPH
- center of graph = (0, 0)
- each axis of graph can represent a value
	- Such as x axis is time and y axis is displacement
		- In 5 seconds, I move two meters _to the east_, so diagonal goes up and right,
		- In 7 seconds, I move two meter _to the west_, so diagonal goes down and right.
		- this is a **distance vs time graph**.
		- to find speed, we use the gradient.
			- On the first diagonal, gradient is _positive_.
			- On the second diagonal, gradient is _negative_.
