Here is our plan:
- Spread propaganda though posters, songs, movies, books, newspapers, and TV
- Convert political dissidents into believers like the Ministry of Love does (book will touch on this later)
- Push propaganda into kids at a young age
- establish a secret service to monitor civilians
- Create stricter policies to make communing between civilians, e.g. curfew
- Make essential commodities very expensive through the banking system while convincing the public that it is normal with e.g. a war
- Spread misinformation through ISPs and the general internet, or restrict use of the internet in its entirety
- Abolish the judicial system so all criminals will be persecuted without mercy
