Contact with the ground (it should occur on the ball of the foot), In this stage of the knee, ankle and hip are limited in bending, to create a momentum to propel the body forward and upward.
Over striders ...
2. Recovery
The leg bends, the hip flexes, and the foot leave the ground driven toward the butt, meanwhile there is the other leg swing and the cycle restarts.
# The forces
The contact of the foot with the ground should be below/ in line with the center of gravity as in that point the forces are in balance.

The landing on the ball of the foot act like a lever to propel the body forward and up.
# Running anatomy
## Achilles tendon
- The most powerful tendon of the whole body
- Acts as a spring to push the body forward in running
- Contraction of the gastrocnemius and the soleus translate to a force to the Achilles tendon
- Produces ...
## Hamstring
- Involved in leg flexion
## Quadriceps 
- Involved in leg extension
- These two muscles balance each other, being each agonist and antagonist of each other
## Gluteus
- The biggest muscle in the body
- Controls the flexion of the trunk
- Decelerates the leg in the swing stage
## Arms
- Swinging your arms helps to stabilize the trunk and to transfer the stability to the hip
	- Unstable upper body affects the lower body
